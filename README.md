# SSHBandit
Overthewire ssh bandit wargame 

This is a simple script to automate the process of connecting to the different levels of the overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/

The program can take two parsing options

Either -n / --number and following up with and integer . This connects to the ssh level you specify with the integer 

With -c / --cycle and following up with an integer , you start with the level you specify and then it continues on as a loop for the rest of the levels 

It is working for both windows and linux
